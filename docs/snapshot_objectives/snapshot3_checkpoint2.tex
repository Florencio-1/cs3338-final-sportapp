\section*{Snapshot 3 – Checkpoint 2 Objective}

For Snapshot 3, our goal is to add the second large feature:
favorites and the “My Favorites” page.

\subsection*{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Allow the user to mark or unmark a game as a favorite
        from the games list.
  \item Create a “My Favorites” page that shows only favorited games.
  \item Add backend endpoints and database support for storing favorites.
  \item Update SDD, SRS, user manual, and design spec to include
        the favorites feature and page.
  \item Add TestRail cases for adding/removing favorites and viewing
        the favorites list.
  \item Update the workflow diagram to show how favorites data flows
        between frontend, backend, and database.
\end{itemize}
