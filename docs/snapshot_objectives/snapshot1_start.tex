\section*{Snapshot 1 – Start Objective}

For Snapshot 1, our goal is to plan and set up the SportHub sports web
application.

\subsection*{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Define the main purpose of SportHub:
        a multi-sport scores and favorites tracker.
  \item Choose the core tech stack:
        React frontend, Node.js/Express backend,
        PostgreSQL database, Docker for deployment.
  \item Create the GitHub repository and base folder structure
        (frontend, backend, docker, docs, jira, testrail, workflow).
  \item Create initial LaTeX skeletons for SDD, SRS, user manual,
        design spec, and snapshot objectives.
  \item Set up the initial Jira sprint with tasks for planning and setup.
  \item Create a high-level workflow diagram showing
        User → Frontend → Backend → Database.
\end{itemize}
