\section*{Snapshot 2 – Checkpoint 1 Objective}

For Snapshot 2, our goal was to begin implementing the first large feature
of SportHub: viewing games by sport and date.

\subsection*{Completed Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented a basic \textbf{All Games} frontend page that lists games
        with sport, teams, date, and time using mock data in JavaScript
        (\texttt{frontend/index.html} and \texttt{frontend/script.js}).
  \item Added simple filters for sport (All, NBA, NFL, MLB) so users can limit
        the list to a single sport.
  \item Updated the SDD, SRS, user manual, and design spec to describe the
        current All Games feature and the overall architecture.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Next Steps}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a backend endpoint (with mock data or a simple database table)
        to return a list of games for the All Games page.
  \item Extend the frontend to load games from the backend API instead of
        using only local mock data.
  \item Set up TestRail and create test cases for listing and filtering games.
  \item Update the workflow diagram to show the full flow for viewing games
        (User $\rightarrow$ Frontend $\rightarrow$ Backend $\rightarrow$ Database).
\end{itemize}
